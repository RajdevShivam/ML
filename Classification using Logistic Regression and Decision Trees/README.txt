All the codes are written in python IDE Spyder(Python 3.7)
Make sure libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn etc are already installed.

Task 1:

There are functions which I defined for all kind of scaling and used it to scale the data.
After scaling the data it was saved as csv files and then manually moved to data folder.
All the functions defined were called via main function. The code is mostly self explanotory there

Task 2:
Function for logistic regression was written and results from that are compared with those of logistic regression from SK learn
Functions for precision, recall and accuracy were used from sk learn
SK Learn packages were used for 3fold cross validation and for precission accuracy and recal
Data set which was used was generated in task 1.
Results which were obtained are:

Mean Accuracy
Own code: 0.8786741713570981 || SK Learn package: 0.8780487804878049
Mean Precision
Own code: 0.5859772816294555 || SK Learn package: 0.5830632461730022
Mean recall
Own code: 0.3498093826114583 || SK Learn package: 0.3402855730876487

Task 3:
Coding decision tree was complete but was not able to code predict for that.
SK Learn packages were used for 3fold cross validation and for precission accuracy and recall
