All the codes are written in python IDE Spyder(Python 3.7)
Make sure libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn etc are already installed.

Task:Dataset Preparation

2. Make sure the filename or path which is essentially fed to "pd.read_csv('filename')" is written properly.
3. Put suitable name or path of the csv files consisting of generated dataset on the lines "to_csv('filename')"

Task Part 1: Writing Neural Network
1. Code for this is "Part_1.py"
2. Make sure the filename or path which is essentially fed to "pd.read_csv('filename')" is written properly. Here we have used dataset generated from above task
3. You just need to run the file to get output

Task Part 2: Using library
1. Code for this is "Part_2.py"
2. Make sure the filename or path which is essentially fed to "pd.read_csv('filename')" is written properly. Here we have used dataset generated from above task
3. You just need to run the file to get output

All the generated datasets are stored in data
